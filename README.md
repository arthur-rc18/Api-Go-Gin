This is a project with the main objective  to show the creation of an API using the go framework **gin**.

This API consists in showing by name the knights of the round table.

The data is being stored in a **PostgreSql** database. I'm using Docker to run a PostgreSql image.

The code is already tested in the *main_test.go* file. The functions are documented too, in the *controller.go* file, the documentation was made using swagger. There are also other possibilities to watch that data, in a **json** and **yaml** format inside the *docs* folder.
